Available as an Add-on, the **Apps Script Configuration Client** provides administrators with the ability to configure a SitesWrapper site using a Google Apps spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet Add-on covers all aspects of the site as well as the ability to add or remove Page, Landing and Item objects or Google Sites within the content menus of pages.

Settings defined in the spreadsheet are propagated on demand to the entity objects in the GAE datastore.
